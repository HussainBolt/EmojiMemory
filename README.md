**Memory - Emoji Version!**

This is the game called memory which typically has 72 cards, but theres also a 36 card version which I used for less clutter.

The point of the game is to find as many pairs of matching cards as fast as you can, or if it's a two player version, get more pairs than the other player.
All cards are flipped over on their front and randomized. Every time you pick two cards that are not matching they will turn back over. If they are matching, then they stay flipped up. Try to memorize where each emoji is so you can be the quickest and get the most pairs!
